# game615-spring2023-final

Our one page 'hype doc' is in the repository!
Update: While the game runs in full just fine when playing in Unity (starting from "mainscene") our web build seems to run into a cascade of errors
after our intro text is displayed. None of us have any experience debugging web builds, and are unable to resolve the issue.
